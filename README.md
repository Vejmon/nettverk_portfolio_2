this project consist of two programs, a modified version of simpleperf, 
and a protocol called DRTP used to reliably transmit packages.

the project transmits an image from a client using the img folder.
then a copy of the image is stored at the server in a folder called ut.
the project can also transmit gibberish and not store it at the server.

the server transmits the image kameleon.jpg in the img folder by default.
